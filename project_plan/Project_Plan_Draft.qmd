# Project Title:

Predicting the Forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans in Washington, DC.

# Group Members

-   Michael Lewis (427)

-   Peter Magee (627)

-   Ethan Wong (427)

# Topic

Using publicly available data on PPP loans for business in DC, we seek to develop models that will explore/predict what factors were important for loan forgiveness -- and if so by how much -- and whether these things can be used to predict whether a loan was forgiven.

Below is what our dataset looks like.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
read_csv("PPP details.csv") -> dc
dc %>% head()
```

# Questions of Interest

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated \$525 Billion USD was disbursed as part of the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) @house_fact_2022. These loans, while crucial for protecting American industry and the workforce, have been met with allegations of fraud and controversy -- in some cases spurring litigation @pfeiffer_how_2023. Today, the vast majority of the loans have been forgiven @pfeiffer_how_2023 @noauthor_firms_2021. Analyzing this load data presents an opportunity to better understand (1) what business characteristics are associated with higher loan amounts, (2) what factors led to loan forgiveness -- and whether the amount forgiven varied based on these things, and finally (3) whether ML techniques can be used to predict whether a loan was forgiven off these considerations.

### Regression:

-   How can we assess the relationship between `Amount forgiven` and other variables like `Rent`, `Jobs reported`, `Business type`, `Industry`, `Age of business`, `Utilities`, etc.?

### Classification:

-   Can we predict the `Amount Foregiveness` in PPP loans using variables such as `Rent`, `Jobs reported`, `Business Type`, etc.?

# Approaches

-   We propose using logistic regression, KNN, LDA, QDA to predict whether a loan was forgiven in whole or not.
-   We also propose using linear regression (with cross-validation) to quantify the numerical effect of business characteristics on amount forgiven.

# Group Responsibilities

We will be using the shared repository workflow method. We have agreed to meet each week to discuss the responsibilities and sections that each member will be working on for that week to in order to deconflict. We have all communicated that we will be diligent to use `git pull` when we begin working and to create branches when we are making any changes. Before merging, we will also use pull requests to discuss and review the changes as a team. We will also use the issues tab on GitHub to communicate potential areas for revision. In order to track our workflow, we will not delete the branches and will include comments on individual contributions.

In addition to what was outlined above we have divided the following tasks accordingly. We will revisit and tune these roles as needed:

-   Tidy and clean data prior to analysis (Michael and Pete).

-   Serve as point of contact for reaching out to Professor Ressler (Margaret).

-   Formatting and designing poster (collaborative).

-   Leverage SML tools to analyse data in service to answering the outlined questions (collaborative).

-   Executive Summary (Pete).

-   Writing about selection of data and any in cleaning the data set (Michael).

-   Identification and description of stakeholders and ethical consideration (Ethan).

# Deliverable

-   Our final deliverable will be in the poster format.
