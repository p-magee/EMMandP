## Machine Learning to Analyze Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Data

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated $525 Billion USD was disbursed as part of the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) House (2022). These loans, while crucial for protecting American industry and the workforce, have been met with alle- gations of fraud and controversy – in some cases spurring litigation Pfeiffer and Fast (2023). Today, the vast majority of the loans have been forgiven Pfeiffer and Fast (2023) “Some Firms Thrived During Covid and Then Got Their PPP Covid Relief Loans Forgiven” (2021). Analyzing this load data presents an opportunity to better understand (1) what business char- acteristics are associated with higher loan amounts, (2) what factors led to loan forgiveness – and whether the amount forgiven varied based on these things, and finally (3) whether ML techniques can be used to predict whether a loan was forgiven off these considerations.
